=======

The Meraxes semi-analytic galaxy formation model.

**Author**: [Simon Mutch](http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~smutch/index.html) (*The University of Melbourne*)

**Note: This code is in pre-release phase and contains unpublished physical recipes and code implementations.  Please do not distribute this code without permission or copy any portions.  All rights reserved!**

Requirements
------------

* [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
* [FFTW3](http://www.fftw.org) built with `--enable-float --enable-mpi` ([see installation docs](http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Installation-on-Unix.html#Installation-on-Unix)).
* [MLOG](https://github.com/smutch/mlog) (This is packaged with Meraxes as a git submodule and will be built automatically.)
* [HDF5](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) built with MPI bindings.


Optional
--------

* A NVIDIA GPU and [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) to accelerate the reionisation calculation

How to contribute
=================

1. Fork the [official repository](https://bitbucket.org/dragons-astro/meraxes).
2. Make your changes in a new, appropriately named branch (e.g. `mutch_starformation` or `fix_progenitor_order`).
    * All git commit messages should loosely follow the [standard format outlined here](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
    * Ensure your new code is commented enough so that others can understand what it's doing.
3. Issue a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) to the official repository.
